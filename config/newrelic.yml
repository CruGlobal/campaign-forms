  # Application Name
  # Set this to be the name of your application as you'd like it show
  # up in New Relic.  New Relic will then auto-map instances of your application
  # into a New Relic "application" on your home dashboard page. If you want
  # to map this instance into multiple apps, like "AJAX Requests" and
  # "All UI" then specify a semicolon-separated list of up to three
  # distinct names.  If you comment this out, it defaults to the
  # capitalized RAILS_ENV (i.e., Production, Staging, etc)
  app_name: CampaignForms

  # The newrelic agent generates its own log file to keep its logging
  # information separate from that of your application.  Specify its
  # log level here.
  log_level: info

# Environment-specific settings are in this section.
# RAILS_ENV or RACK_ENV (as appropriate) is used to determine the environment.
# If your application has other named environments, configure them here.
